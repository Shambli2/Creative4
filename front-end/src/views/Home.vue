  <p class="text1">At So Pinking Cute we sell handmade statement earrings. Our earrings are made from polymer clay, which means even the biggest earrings are light on your ears! Any metals that we use are hypo-allergenic and nickel free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides our displayed products, we take custom orders! While most of our earrings are unique or one of a kind, we will remake already-sold earrings as similarly as possible if requested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When you buy from our small business, you support four sisters ages 21, 14, 12, and 9 who were crazy enough to start this up together (and who, let's be real, are just crazy).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We do our best to keep our earrings affordable, and absorb any shipping costs after $4.00 no matter how much you buy. We promise that although our earrings are priced lower than the majority of polymer clay earrings out there, we do not skimp on quality of materials or design. We just want cute earrings to be as accessible as possible to all!
